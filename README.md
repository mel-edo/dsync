# dsync - A cross platform LAN file synchronization tool

---

## Goal

Building a lightweight, rust based daemon that allows for real time file synchronization over LAN across multiple devices without cloud or centralized servers, ensuring fast and private folder mirroring.

- Lightweight & efficient → small resource footprint, suitable for always-on background use.

- LAN-only → no internet/cloud reliance, purely local.

- Automatic sync → creation, modification, and deletion events reflected across devices.

- Decentralized → no single server, all peers participate equally.

- Privacy-focused → stays entirely within the local network.
